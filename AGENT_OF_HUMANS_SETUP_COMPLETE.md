# Agent of Humans - Setup Complete ✅

**Date:** October 18, 2025
**Status:** Fully Operational

---

## Summary

All gaps in the Agent of Humans (Community Request) workflow have been addressed and deployed to production.

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Concierge Rendering Gaps ✅

**Problem:** Concierge agent couldn't present community responses or impact notifications.

**Solution:**
- Added handlers for `community_response` and `expert_impact_notification` priority types
- Created `renderCommunityResponse()` for delivering expert insights to requesters
- Created `renderExpertImpactNotification()` for close-the-loop feedback to experts
- Updated shared TypeScript types

**Deployed:** twilio-webhook revision 00034

### 2. Comprehensive E2E Testing ✅

**Created:** `packages/testing/src/e2e/agent-of-humans-flow.test.ts`

**Coverage:**
- 9 test scenarios covering all 13 implemented steps
- Full lifecycle from request creation to close-the-loop
- All tests passing ✅

**Run tests:**
```bash
cd packages/testing
npm test -- agent-of-humans-flow.test.ts
```

### 3. Request Closure System ✅

**Problem:** Community requests never expired or closed.

**Solution:**
- Created closure handler in `event-processor/src/handlers/community-closure.ts`
- Automatically closes requests when:
  - 7 days have passed since creation
  - All targeted experts have responded
- Updates all related records (requests, responses, priorities)

**Deployed:** event-processor revision 00005

### 4. Automated Scheduling ✅

**Approach:** Google Cloud Scheduler (instead of pg_cron)

**Setup:**
- Cloud Scheduler job runs every hour
- Calls: `POST https://event-processor-82471900833.us-central1.run.app/close-expired-requests`
- Timezone: America/Los_Angeles
- State: ENABLED ✅

## Testing & Monitoring

### Health Check
```bash
curl https://event-processor-82471900833.us-central1.run.app/community-requests-health | jq
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "openRequests": 0,
  "expiredRequests": 0,
  "fullyRespondedRequests": 0
}
```

### Manual Closure Trigger
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}' \
  https://event-processor-82471900833.us-central1.run.app/close-expired-requests | jq
```

### View Scheduler Job
```bash
gcloud scheduler jobs describe close-expired-community-requests --location=us-central1
```

### Trigger Manually (for testing)
```bash
# Note: May hit quota limits if triggered too frequently
gcloud scheduler jobs run close-expired-community-requests --location=us-central1
```

### View Scheduler Logs
```bash
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_scheduler_job AND resource.labels.job_id=close-expired-community-requests" --limit=10
```

## Next Steps

### For Production
1. **Monitor the scheduler** - Check logs after the first hour to verify it runs successfully
2. **Test with real users** - Once out of private beta, test the complete flow
3. **Add analytics** (Step 15) - Build dashboards for community engagement metrics

### Optional Improvements
- Add Slack notifications when requests are closed
- Create admin dashboard to view open/closed requests
- Add user-facing "My Community Questions" page
- Implement request expiry reminders (before 7 days)

## Architecture Notes

### Why Cloud Scheduler Instead of pg_cron?

**Decision:** Use Google Cloud Scheduler

**Reasons:**
1. ✅ No dependency on Supabase extensions
2. ✅ Easier to monitor and debug (Cloud Console logs)
3. ✅ Can call any HTTP endpoint
4. ✅ Built-in retry logic and error handling
5. ✅ Free tier: 3 jobs/month

**Tradeoff:**
- pg_cron would be slightly faster (no HTTP call)
- But Cloud Scheduler is more flexible and maintainable

### Flow Architecture

```
User 1 (Requester)
  ↓ asks question
Concierge Agent
  ↓ publishes community.request_needed event
Event Processor
  ↓ creates community_request + tasks for experts
Account Manager (Expert)
  ↓ adds to expert's user_priorities
Concierge (Expert)
  ↓ presents request when expert messages
Expert responds
  ↓
Concierge (Expert)
  ↓ records response + publishes community.response_received event
Event Processor
  ↓ creates tasks for evaluation + delivery
Task Processor
  ↓ evaluates usefulness, awards credits
Account Manager (Requester)
  ↓ adds response to requester's priorities
Concierge (Requester)
  ↓ delivers insight to requester [FIXED]
Account Manager (Expert)
  ↓ schedules impact notification (24h delay)
Concierge (Expert)
  ↓ delivers close-the-loop message [FIXED]

Cloud Scheduler (every hour)
  ↓ calls /close-expired-requests
Event Processor
  ↓ closes expired requests [IMPLEMENTED]
```
