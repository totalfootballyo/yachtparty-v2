## üìä Architecture Highlights

### Event-Driven Saga Orchestration
‚úÖ All inter-agent communication via events table
‚úÖ PostgreSQL NOTIFY/LISTEN for real-time processing
‚úÖ Complete audit trail for debugging
‚úÖ No circular dependencies between agents

### Stateless Agent Design
‚úÖ Agents load context fresh from DB on each invocation
‚úÖ State persisted in database tables (solution_workflows, intro_opportunities)
‚úÖ Enables replay, debugging, and horizontal scaling

### Message Discipline
‚úÖ Strict rate limiting (5-10 messages/day default)
‚úÖ Priority-based message queue
‚úÖ Quiet hours enforcement (10pm-8am local time)
‚úÖ Message relevance checking before sending

### Database-First Architecture
‚úÖ PostgreSQL handles queuing, events, scheduling
‚úÖ pg_cron for background task processing
‚úÖ FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED prevents race conditions
‚úÖ Event sourcing for credits (idempotency keys)
