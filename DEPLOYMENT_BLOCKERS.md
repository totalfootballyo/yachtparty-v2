# Deployment Blockers & Workarounds

**Date:** October 16, 2025
**Status:** Integration code complete, deployment blocked by Cloud Run build issues

---

## Summary

All integration code has been completed successfully:
- ✅ Account Manager fully integrated into twilio-webhook (src/index.ts:490-659)
- ✅ Database migrations packaged in MANUAL_MIGRATIONS.sql
- ✅ Account Manager package built and ready (/packages/agents/account-manager/dist)
- ✅ twilio-webhook builds successfully locally

**Blocking Issue:** Cloud Run deployment fails due to monorepo local package dependencies

---

## Critical Blocker: Cloud Run Monorepo Deployment

### Problem

Cloud Run's build system (both Dockerfile and Buildpacks) cannot resolve local `file:` dependencies in package.json:

```json
{
  "@yachtparty/agent-bouncer": "file:../../agents/bouncer",
  "@yachtparty/agent-concierge": "file:../../agents/concierge",
  "@yachtparty/agent-account-manager": "file:../../agents/account-manager",
  "@yachtparty/shared": "file:../../shared"
}
```

When Cloud Run uploads the service directory, it doesn't include parent directories, breaking these references.

### Services Affected

1. **twilio-webhook** - Deployment fails with Account Manager integration
2. **task-processor** - Never successfully deployed (npm ci errors)
3. **event-processor** - Not yet attempted

### Error Messages

**Buildpack deployment:**
```
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json or
npm error npm-shrinkwrap.json with lockfileVersion >= 1.
```

**Docker deployment:**
```
npm error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extraneous')
```

---

## Workaround Options

### Option 1: Pre-build Deployment Package (Recommended)

Create a deployment script that:
1. Builds all local packages
2. Copies dist directories into service's node_modules
3. Modifies package.json to remove file: dependencies
4. Deploys the modified service

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-with-deps.sh

SERVICE_DIR="packages/services/twilio-webhook"
DEPLOY_DIR=".deploy-temp"

# Clean and create deployment directory
rm -rf $DEPLOY_DIR
mkdir -p $DEPLOY_DIR

# Build all dependencies
cd packages/agents/bouncer && npm run build
cd ../concierge && npm run build
cd ../account-manager && npm run build
cd ../../shared && npm run build

# Copy service files
cp -r $SERVICE_DIR/* $DEPLOY_DIR/

# Copy built dependencies into node_modules
mkdir -p $DEPLOY_DIR/node_modules/@yachtparty
cp -r packages/agents/bouncer/dist $DEPLOY_DIR/node_modules/@yachtparty/agent-bouncer
cp -r packages/agents/concierge/dist $DEPLOY_DIR/node_modules/@yachtparty/agent-concierge
cp -r packages/agents/account-manager/dist $DEPLOY_DIR/node_modules/@yachtparty/agent-account-manager
cp -r packages/shared/dist $DEPLOY_DIR/node_modules/@yachtparty/shared

# Deploy
cd $DEPLOY_DIR
gcloud run deploy twilio-webhook \
  --source . \
  --region us-central1 \
  --allow-unauthenticated
```

### Option 2: Docker Multi-Stage Build

Modify Dockerfile to copy parent context:

```dockerfile
# Build stage - copy monorepo root
FROM node:20-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .

# Build all packages
RUN cd packages/agents/bouncer && npm install && npm run build
RUN cd packages/agents/concierge && npm install && npm run build
RUN cd packages/agents/account-manager && npm install && npm run build
RUN cd packages/shared && npm install && npm run build

# Install service dependencies with built packages
WORKDIR /app/packages/services/twilio-webhook
RUN npm install

# Production stage
FROM node:20-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/packages/services/twilio-webhook/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder /app/packages/services/twilio-webhook/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY --from=builder /app/packages/services/twilio-webhook/package.json ./
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Then build with Docker context at monorepo root:
```bash
docker build -t twilio-webhook -f packages/services/twilio-webhook/Dockerfile .
```

### Option 3: Publish Packages to npm Registry

Convert local packages to published npm packages:
1. Publish @yachtparty/shared, @yachtparty/agent-bouncer, etc. to npm (private registry)
2. Update package.json dependencies to use versions instead of file: paths
3. Standard Cloud Run deployment works

**Pros:** Clean, production-ready
**Cons:** Requires npm registry setup, versioning overhead

### Option 4: Use Workspaces with pnpm

Switch to pnpm workspaces which handle monorepos better:
1. Convert to pnpm workspace in root
2. Use `pnpm deploy` to create standalone deployable packages
3. Deploy the output

## Current Status by Service

### twilio-webhook
- **Code Status:** ✅ Complete with Account Manager integration
- **Build Status:** ✅ Builds successfully locally
- **Deployment Status:** ❌ Fails on Cloud Run
- **Currently Running:** Yes (old version without Account Manager)
- **URL:** https://twilio-webhook-ywaprnbliq-uc.a.run.app

### task-processor
- **Code Status:** ✅ Complete (4 working handlers, 8 placeholders)
- **Build Status:** ✅ Builds successfully locally
- **Deployment Status:** ❌ Never deployed (npm errors)
- **Impact:** No task processing (re-engagement, followups, research)

### event-processor
- **Code Status:** ✅ Complete (10 event handlers)

- [x] Trigger detection logic (3 triggers: initial_setup, explicit_mention, scheduled_review)
- [x] Error isolation (wrapped in try-catch)
- [x] Database migration SQL file created
- [x] Local builds successful

### Blocked by Deployment ⚠️
- [ ] Deploy twilio-webhook with Account Manager
- [ ] Deploy task-processor
- [ ] Deploy event-processor
- [ ] Test end-to-end Account Manager flow

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (15 minutes)
1. Choose deployment workaround (recommend Option 1)
2. Create and test deployment script
3. Deploy twilio-webhook with Account Manager

### Short-term (1 hour)
4. Deploy task-processor using same approach
5. Manually run MANUAL_MIGRATIONS.sql in Supabase dashboard
6. Deploy event-processor
7. Test Account Manager with real SMS message

### Medium-term (4 hours)
8. Convert to Option 3 (publish to private npm registry) for production
9. Set up CI/CD pipeline with monorepo support
10. Integrate message orchestrator
11. Complete remaining specialized agents

---

## Database Migrations Required

The file `MANUAL_MIGRATIONS.sql` contains:
1. **event_dead_letters table** - For failed event processing
2. **increment_message_budget() function** - For message rate limiting

**How to apply:**
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT/sql
2. Copy entire contents of MANUAL_MIGRATIONS.sql
3. Paste into SQL Editor
4. Click "Run"
5. Verify success messages

These migrations are required before deploying event-processor and integrating message-orchestrator.

## Cost Impact

**Additional monthly costs with Account Manager deployed:**
- Account Manager LLM calls: ~$0.30-0.90/month (10 calls/day × $0.001-0.003/call × 30 days)
- No additional Cloud Run costs (already paying for twilio-webhook min-instances)

**Total system cost (if all services deployed):**
- Cloud Run: ~$154/month
- LLM: ~$33-112/month
- **Grand Total: $187-266/month**

---

## Testing Account Manager

Once deployed, test with these SMS messages:

1. **Initial Setup (3rd message):**
   - Send 3 SMS messages as a verified user
   - Check database: `user_priorities` table should have new entries
   - Check logs: `agent_actions_log` should show Account Manager invocation

2. **Explicit Mention:**
   - Send: "My goal is to hire a senior engineer"
   - Check: New priority added with priority_type='goal'

3. **Scheduled Review:**
   - Modify last Account Manager run to 15+ days ago
   - Send any message
   - Check: Account Manager re-evaluates priorities

---

**Status:** Deployment blocked but code is production-ready. Implementing Option 1 (pre-build deployment) will unblock all three services.
