## Previously Blocked Services (Now Resolved)

### ‚úÖ event-processor (RESOLVED)

**Status:** Successfully Deployed
**Previous Blocker:** MODULE_NOT_FOUND Error - Cannot find @supabase/supabase-js
**Resolution:** Changed workspace:* to file: syntax + installed dependencies locally

**Root Cause:**
Service has `workspace:*` dependencies in package.json but node_modules are not properly installed in deployment container.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@yachtparty/shared": "workspace:*",
  "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.39.0"
}
```

**Error Details:**
```
Error: Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'
Require stack:
  - /app/packages/services/event-processor/dist/utils/supabase.js
```

**Analysis:**
The build process runs `npm install` at workspace root, but the deployed container doesn't have access to the installed dependencies. The service needs either:
1. Dependencies installed locally in service directory, OR
2. Dockerfile modified to copy workspace node_modules, OR
3. Build process that bundles all dependencies

**Files Involved:**
- `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/packages/services/event-processor/package.json`
- `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/packages/services/event-processor/Dockerfile`
- `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/scripts/deploy-service.sh`

**Attempted Fixes:**
- None yet - issue identified during deployment

---

### ‚úÖ message-orchestrator (RESOLVED)

**Status:** Successfully Deployed
**Previous Blocker:** npm Corruption + Missing HTTP Server + Dependency Issues
**Resolution:** Force reinstall + HTTP wrapper + full node_modules copy

**Root Cause:**
npm package manager in corrupted state causing build failures.

**Error Details:**
```
npm error Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extraneous')
```

**Analysis:**
The error occurs during `npm install` or dependency resolution. This is a known npm bug that occurs when:
1. package-lock.json is out of sync with package.json
2. npm cache is corrupted
3. node_modules has stale/inconsistent state

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. ‚úó `npm cache clean --force` - Did not resolve issue
2. ‚úó Deleted node_modules and reinstalled - Did not resolve issue
3. ‚úó Deleted package-lock.json and regenerated - Not attempted yet

**Additional Context:**
Package location is `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/packages/orchestrator/` (NOT `/packages/services/message-orchestrator/`). This is a workspace package that needs to be deployed as a service.

**Files Involved:**
- `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/packages/orchestrator/package.json`
- `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/packages/orchestrator/package-lock.json`
- `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/package-lock.json` (workspace root)

## Critical Bug Fixes During Session

### üêõ Email Verification UUID Format Bug

**Service:** Bouncer Agent
**Severity:** High - Blocking user onboarding
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

**Issue:**
Email verification was 99% complete but had a critical bug in UUID format handling. The verification token UUID was being generated with hyphens but stored/compared without hyphens, causing all verification attempts to fail.

**Location:** `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/packages/agents/bouncer/src/onboarding-steps.ts`
**Lines:** 182-185

**Original Code:**
```typescript
verification_token: crypto.randomUUID(), // Generates: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
// But verification URL expects: "550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000" (no hyphens)
```

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
verification_token: crypto.randomUUID().replace(/-/g, ''), // Generates: "550e8400e29b41d4a716446655440000"
```

**Impact:**
- Email verification now works correctly
- Users can complete onboarding flow
- Bouncer agent can transition users to Concierge

**Handled by:** Sub-Agent B

## Deployment Infrastructure Updates

### ‚úÖ deploy-service.sh Enhancement

**Location:** `/Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty v.2/scripts/deploy-service.sh`

**Enhancement:** Added support for `message-orchestrator` service deployment

**Changes:**
- Added case statement for `message-orchestrator` pointing to `/packages/orchestrator/`
- Maintains consistency with other service deployments
- Supports the non-standard package location for orchestrator

**Impact:**
- Orchestrator can now be deployed using same script as other services
- Command: `./scripts/deploy-service.sh message-orchestrator`
- Currently blocked by npm corruption issue

---

## Detailed Troubleshooting Steps

### For event-processor MODULE_NOT_FOUND Issue

**Recommended Fix #1: Install Dependencies Locally**

1. Navigate to service directory:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty\ v.2/packages/services/event-processor
   ```

2. Install dependencies locally:
   ```bash
   npm install --include=workspace-root
   ```

3. Verify node_modules exists:
   ```bash
   ls -la node_modules/@supabase
   ```

4. Update Dockerfile to copy local node_modules:
   ```dockerfile
   # In builder stage, after COPY package*.json
   COPY packages/services/event-processor/node_modules ./packages/services/event-processor/node_modules
   ```

5. Rebuild and deploy:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-service.sh event-processor
   ```

**Recommended Fix #2: Bundle Dependencies**

1. Install esbuild or webpack in service:
   ```bash
   cd packages/services/event-processor
   npm install --save-dev esbuild
   ```

2. Add build script to package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "bundle": "esbuild src/index.ts --bundle --platform=node --target=node18 --outfile=dist/bundle.js"
   }
   ```

3. Update Dockerfile to use bundled output:
   ```dockerfile
   RUN npm run bundle
   CMD ["node", "dist/bundle.js"]
   ```

**Recommended Fix #3: Multi-Stage Build with Workspace**

1. Update Dockerfile to install workspace dependencies:
   ```dockerfile
   # Install workspace dependencies at root
   COPY package*.json ./
   COPY packages/shared/package*.json ./packages/shared/
   RUN npm install --workspaces

   # Then copy and build service
   COPY packages/services/event-processor ./packages/services/event-processor
   RUN npm run build --workspace=@yachtparty/event-processor
   ```

### For message-orchestrator npm Corruption Issue

**Recommended Fix #1: Fresh npm State**

1. Delete ALL npm-related files:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty\ v.2
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   cd packages/orchestrator
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```

2. Clear npm cache completely:
   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   npm cache verify
   ```

3. Reinstall from scratch:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty\ v.2
   npm install
   ```

4. Verify orchestrator dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd packages/orchestrator
   npm list
   ```

**Recommended Fix #2: Use pnpm Instead**

npm workspaces have known issues. Consider switching to pnpm:

1. Install pnpm globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pnpm
   ```

2. Convert workspace to pnpm:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bt/Desktop/CODE/Yachtparty\ v.2
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Update deployment script to use pnpm:
   ```bash
   # In deploy-service.sh, replace npm with pnpm
   pnpm install --filter=@yachtparty/orchestrator
   pnpm run build --filter=@yachtparty/orchestrator
   ```

**Recommended Fix #3: Deploy as Standalone**

If workspace issues persist, temporarily deploy orchestrator as standalone service:

1. Copy orchestrator to services directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r packages/orchestrator packages/services/message-orchestrator
   ```

2. Update package.json to use direct dependencies instead of workspace:*:
   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "@supabase/supabase-js": "^2.39.0",
     "@anthropic-ai/sdk": "^0.30.1"
   }
   ```

3. Copy shared types directly into service
4. Deploy using standard service deployment flow

## Next Steps for Complete Deployment

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix event-processor workspace dependencies**
   - Choose and implement one of the three recommended fixes above
   - Test build locally before deploying
   - Deploy to Cloud Run and verify health endpoint

2. **Resolve message-orchestrator npm corruption**
   - Start with "Fresh npm State" fix
   - If that fails, consider switching to pnpm
   - Last resort: deploy as standalone service

3. **Verify task-processor in production**
   - Test health endpoint
   - Trigger test task to verify handler execution
   - Monitor logs for errors

### Testing & Validation (Medium Priority)

4. **End-to-end task processing test**
   - Create test task in agent_tasks table
   - Verify task-processor picks it up
   - Confirm handler executes correctly
   - Check event publishing works

5. **End-to-end event processing test**
   - Publish test event to events table
   - Verify event-processor picks it up (once deployed)
   - Confirm handler executes correctly

6. **Message orchestrator integration test**
   - Queue test message in message_queue table
   - Verify orchestrator processes it (once deployed)
   - Confirm rate limiting logic works
   - Test quiet hours enforcement

### Documentation & Monitoring (Low Priority)

7. **Update deployment documentation**
   - Document workspace dependency issues in DEPLOYMENT.md
   - Add troubleshooting section for MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors
   - Document npm corruption workarounds

8. **Set up monitoring alerts**
   - Cloud Run error rate >2%
   - Service health check failures
   - Task processing backlog >100 pending tasks

9. **Create deployment checklist**
   - Pre-deployment verification steps
   - Post-deployment validation steps
   - Rollback procedures

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **Backup Strategy Saved Time** - Having Dockerfile backup allowed quick recovery from accidental overwrites
2. **TypeScript Strict Mode Caught Issues** - Unused imports and type errors found during compilation, not runtime
3. **Sub-Agent Collaboration Effective** - Parallel work on different services accelerated debugging
4. **deploy-service.sh Flexibility** - Script easily extended to support new service locations

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Monorepo Dependency Management** - workspace:* dependencies cause deployment issues
   - **Recommendation:** Use dependency bundling or install deps locally in each service

2. **npm Workspace Reliability** - Known issues with npm workspaces cause blocking errors
   - **Recommendation:** Consider migrating to pnpm workspaces

3. **Pre-deployment Validation** - No automated check to verify dependencies installed
   - **Recommendation:** Add pre-deployment script that validates node_modules exists

4. **Service Package Structure** - Inconsistent locations (orchestrator vs services/)
   - **Recommendation:** Standardize all deployable services under packages/services/

### Development Process Insights

1. **Email Verification Was 99% Complete** - Only needed UUID format fix, not full reimplementation
2. **Event-processor Handlers Already Existed** - Just needed TypeScript fixes, not new implementation
3. **Deployment Script Works** - Core deployment logic is sound, issues are with dependency resolution
4. **Docker Multi-Stage Builds Are Critical** - Proper stage separation prevents issues with dev dependencies
